# File-Sorter
Sorts your file.... into file extension as the folder name



file sorter.py is the code run in your local editor.

Write the path for the folder you want to sort


Warning: First try it in a demo folder with some random images and videos
 
 



Update 

I have included the option to exclude any extensions you don't want to get involved.
